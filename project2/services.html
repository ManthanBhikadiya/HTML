        <p>A full-stack developer is a software engineer who can work on both the front-end (client-side) and back-end
            (server-side) of an application. They possess skills in programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            for
            the front-end, and languages like Python, Node.js, or PHP for the back-end, as well as knowledge of
            databases
            and servers.</p>

        <p>UI/UX design and graphic design are related but distinct fields in the design world. Graphic design focuses
            on
            the visual aesthetics of a project, while UI/UX design focuses on the user experience and interaction with a
            digital product.</p>

            alt="image">
        <p>A backend developer, also known as a back-end developer, is a programmer who specializes in the server-side
            logic, databases, and other components of a web application or software that users don't directly see. They
            are responsible for ensuring the application runs smoothly and efficiently, working behind the scenes to
            handle data processing, server management, and API development. </p>

            experience (UX) of websites and web applications. They focus on what users see and interact with, ensuring
            the site is visually appealing, functional, and easy to navigate. </p>
